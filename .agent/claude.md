# CMDB Design Rules

- **CI Entities**: Only entities that require versioning, lifecycle tracking, and availability monitoring should be designed as Configuration Items (CIs).
- **Static Attributes**: Entities that serve as static attributes or classifications (e.g., Job Titles, Equipment Types, Status labels) should be moved to the **General Catalog**.
